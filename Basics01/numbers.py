# repr() provides a detailed and unambiguous representation of an object, often used for debugging and development.
# str() provides a human-readable representation of an object.
# print() is a built-in function for displaying text or object representations on the console. It implicitly uses str() on its arguments.

# math.floor() will return the floor value.
# math.trunc() will return value closest to zero.

# 0o20 = o for octa
# 0xFF = x for hexa
# 0b100 = b for binary

# Converting numbers
# oct(16)
# hex(64)
# bin(64)
# int('64',8 )  - octa
# int('64', 16 ) - hexa
# int('64', 2 ) - binary
